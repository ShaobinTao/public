- Notations
  Points: A, B, C..
  straight lines: a, b, c, ...
  Planes: ⍺, β, 𝛾... (greek letters)

- elements at infinity, 
  - on any line,  there is one point at infinity, not two.
  - the locus of the points at inf in any plane is called the line at inf in that plane

- Ceva's thorem:  P39

- Menelaus's Theorem: P40

- The pole of perspective is a concept in projective geometry that refers to a point that represents the center of projection for a given perspective transformation.

- Desargues's two-triangle theorem. If two tris have corresponding vertices joined by concurrent lines, then the intersections of the corresponding sides are collinear.

- Pascal's theorem: if a hexagon is inscribed in a conic, the pairs of opposite sides intersect in three collinear points

- a line passing thru 2 points is called their join

- a . b -> intersection of lines a and b

- AB -> join of points A and B

- principle of duality: every definition remains significant and every theorem remains true when we interchange 
    point and line, or join and intersection

- harmonic conjugacy: points C and D are harmonic conjugates (of each other) with respect to A and B

- range: the points on a line
- Pencil: all lines through one point. the point is called the center of the pencil

- perspectivity: 
  for pionts:   perspectivity from a common point O
  for pencels:  the point of intersection of corresponding lines lies on a fixed line 
  the correspondence is called a perspectivity from a point or a line. The symbol is 
      =
      ^

- 2.71: it is possible, by a sequence of 3 perspectivitites, to interchange pairs among any 4 collinear points

- 2.72: it is possible, by a sequence of not more than 3 perspectivitites, to relate any 3 distinct points to any other 3 distinct points

- if A and B seperate C and D, we write AB//CD. for easier understanding, treat A,B,C,D are on a circle

- AB/C (AB without C): all points X for which AB//CX

- S(ABC) = S(DEF): sense ABC agrees with sense DEF.   != means disagree

- The Sylvester-Gallai theorem: Given a finite set of points in the plane, not all lying on a line, there must exist a line that passes through exactly two of the given points.

- The Sylvester-Gallai theorem: if n given points are not all on one line, there exists a line containing exactly two of them.
