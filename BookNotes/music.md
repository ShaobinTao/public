## Chords
- A diminished chord(dim):  root + a minor 3rd + a diminished 5th. Cdim =  C, Eb + Gb
- A minor chord(m):         root + a minor 3rd + a perfect 5th. Cminor = C + Eb + G
- A major chord:            root + a major 3rd + a perfect 5th. Cmajor = C + E  + G
- Augmented Chord(aug or +):root + a major 3rd + a augmented 5th. C_aug/C+ = C + E + G#

## Chord progression (by popularies)
- 1->4->5, For example for g major key, it is G(1) -> A(2) -> B(3) -> C(4) -> D(5). 1->4->5 would be G -> C -> D
- 1->5->4. For example for g major key, it is G(1) -> A(2) -> B(3) -> C(4) -> D(5). 1->5->4 would be G -> D -> C
- 1->6->2 or , found in songs from doo-wop era. For g major key, it is G(1) -> A(2) -> B(3) -> C(4) -> D(5) -> Emin(6). 1->6->2 or 4-- 4th progression is 1->5->6->4, a very popular in broadway, hip songs, and rocks.
>5 would be G -> Emin -> A or C -> D
- 2->5->1
- 3->6
- 4->5 or 4->1
- 5->1


## Gears
  - 1st choice: used MIM strat/tele
  - 2nd choice: Highway1 strat
  - I’ve found local music shops much more honest and helpful than Guitar Center. I usually go to Starving Musician, but I think people love Gryphon in Palo Alto too

- Amplifier <br/>
	Yamaha THR30iiA
	Boss Katana
	Fender (no recording)
	adorama (has apple discount)

## Vacabularies
- barre chord: closed/movable chord(封闭和弦);  barre(ballet daner的扶手）
	- E-shaped barre chord, such as C at 8th fret
 	- A-shaped barre chord, such as C at 3fr
- 
- down/up the fretboard means the pitches will go lower/higher;
- Across refers to taking the inversions from the higher-pitched strings to the lower-pitched strings.
- Diatonic: 全音阶
- Diatonic chord: chords formed with the notes of a single major scale. For example, in the key of C major, F maj(F-A-C) and Emin(E-G-B) would be diatonic to that key. But Dmaj(D-F#-A) is not since F# is not a note of the C maj scale.

For Key C major, all its diatonic chords would be (roman numbers in the left col means degrees of the diatonic chords)

</br>
Noted pattern: i/iv/v are always major chord; iii/vi are always minor; vii will always be diminished. 

Based on above approach, all diatonic chords for all keys are(totally 12 signatures/rows)

If somebody tell you to play a blues song in key D, likely the song would probably just have D-G-A(1->4->5 progression)

- etude: 练习曲
- Open chord/open-position chord/cowboy chord
</br>

- riff: improvisation
- tonic: root/first note of any scale
- transpose songs: change the notes/chords from one key to another.
